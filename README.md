### Starting ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

- Clone the repository:

```
https://github.com/GabrielPivoto/my-catalog.git
```
- Create the network:
```
docker network create inatel
```

- Start the MySql container:

```
docker container run --name mysql --network=inatel -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DATABASE=my_catalog_db -p 3306:3306 -p 33060:33060 -d mysql
```

Now run the project in your IDE, and you're good to go.

### Starting with the Docker Compose üêã

- Clone the repository 
- At the root of the project, run the command:
```
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```
- Also at the root of the project, build the application image:
```
docker build -t my-catalog .
```
- Run the Docker Compose file:
```
docker compose up
```
### How it works ‚öôÔ∏è

In this application, the user can register all movies and series he have already watched. 
It is possible to register a new movie/series; search movies and series that are registered;
 update movie/series; delete movie/series.

üé• To add a new movie/series:

- POST ``http://localhost:8080/show`` - requires the following body:

```
{
    "title": "showTitle",
    "personalScore": score
}
```
üé• To get all movies/series registered:

- GET ``http://localhost:8080/show``
- GET ``http://localhost:8080/show/id`` - gets a show by specific id
- GET ``http://localhost:8080/show?type=movie`` - gets all movies registered
- GET ``http://localhost:8080/show?type=series`` - gets all series registered

üé• To update a movie/series:

- PATCH ``http://localhost:8080/show`` - requires the following body and updates only the personal score.
```
{
    "title": "showTitle",
    "personalScore": score
}
```
üé• To remove a movie/series:

- DELETE ``http://localhost:8080/show/id`` - deletes a show by specific id

### Tests üß™

There are two test classes in the project: ShowControllerTest and ShowServiceTest
. You can either run them from your IDE or run the following command
at the root of the project:

```
mvn test
```

There's also two feature files regarding the methods GET and POST.
To run these tests you just need the CucumberRunnerTests class. A
link to the tests report will be automatically provided.
